### Challenge
Applying AI technology to the early screening and intervention of autistic children, a video-based system is developed to verify gaze estimation for characteristic behaviors of Autism Spectrum Disorder.
### Method
The project is the preliminary work of the system, mainly using OpenCV to detect faces in real time video, then using the Dlib library to estimate the head pose of the testing subjects, and finally obtaining the mathematical model for estimation through nine-point calibration method, solving for the vector coordinates of the pupil-Purkinje spot, to derive the estimate of the gaze.
